The OSI model consists of seven layers (from highest to lowest): Application layer, Presentation layer, Session layer,
Transport layer, Network layer, Data link layer, Physical layer
^This is theoretical and just used as a reference

OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual model, characterizing and standardizing communication functions
of a telecommunication/computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure/technology

This is a description of the Networking subsystem (network stack)

Each logically complete functionality of a networking component is referred to as a layer

Each layer has a specific function/purpose, those functions/purposes do NOT overlap, and data/packets move across
the layers *bi-directionally*

All layers are stacked together to build a complete networking system.
